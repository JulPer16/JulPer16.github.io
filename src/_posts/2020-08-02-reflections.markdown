<h2>Thoughts on pre-compiling CSS</h2>

Since I've had previous experience with writing CSS it has been a little bit of an adjustment to use this new
method of pre-compiling. It was a little bit tricky at first to figure out which things went where, not to
mention trying to find all the files I needed and properly linking them to make sure everything would be
included in the browser.

    <h2>Thoughts on pre-compiling CSS</h2>

<p>Since I’ve had previous experience with writing CSS it has been a little bit of an adjustment to use this new
method of pre-compiling. It was a little bit tricky at first to figure out which things went where, not to
mention trying to find all the files I needed and properly linking them to make sure everything would be
included in the browser. Despite struggling with this new tool, however, I can abslutely see the value in
using this method and look forward to learning more about it, as I’m sure it will be very helpful when
creating websites in the future!</p>

<p>I used Sass for pre-compiling CSS, and to do this I first copied the pre-existing scss files as a base. Here
I immediately ran into an issue, as the folder the files were supposedly in was nowhere to be found. I did
manage to solve this problem by using “Inspect element” in the prowser, clicking the style tab, and simply
downloading the files by clicking “Save” on them and then placing them in my own _sass folder. With these files saved, I went thought them and experimented with changing values to see what happened. I did
struggle a bit with getting things to connect properly, but after a while I got everything to work the way I
wanted it to.</p>

<p>The main obvious pro of using this method is that it’s easy to achieve consistency and it’s much easier to
maintain than writing one’s own CSS code. However it is a bit tricky to learn how Sass relates to CSS and
how to achieve one’s goals, but once you’re past the learning curve it is ultimately a great tool to use.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on static site generators</h2>

<p>Static site generators can be useful for quickly and easily throwing together a website for simple purposes
like for instance sharing information with an organization, uploading a photo gallery, or run a blog. The
fact that a lot of things are automatic can be very convenient for these purposes.</p>

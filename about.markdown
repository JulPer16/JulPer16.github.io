My name is Julia Perlkvist and I'm studying the UDM program at Linnaeus University. Prior to entering the
field of computer science, I studied political science for one year at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall.
I decuded to change my field because as interesting as politicla science may have been, I did unfortunately
not see a lot of appealing career prospects in that area, so I switched to something where I could see a
brighter future.

In my personal life I'm very introverted and a major loner with pretty much only solitary interests. Most
of my free time is spent playing Sims, watching YouTube, modifying clothes, and researching subjects of
interest.
